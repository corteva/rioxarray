Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `rioxarray` for local development.

1. Fork the `rioxarray` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/rioxarray.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ python -m venv rioxarray_env
    $ cd rioxarray/
    $ pip install -e .[dev]

4. Setup pre-commit hooks::

   $ pre-commit install
   $ pre-commit autoupdate

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8, are black formatter,
   and the tests pass::

    $ make check
    $ make test

   Or, if you cannot run makefile commands::

    $ flake8 --ignore=E731,W503,W504 --exclude --max-complexity 10 --max-line-length 88 rioxarray/
    $ flake8 --max-line-length 88 tests/unit/ tests/functional/ tests/integration
    $ black --target-version py36 --check .
    $ py.test

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ py.test test.test_rioxarray
