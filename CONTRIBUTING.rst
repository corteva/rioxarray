Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `rioxarray` for local development.

1. Fork the `rioxarray` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/rioxarray.git

3. Create a python virtual environment

Using conda::

    $ cd rioxarray/
    $ conda env create
    $ conda activate rioxarray

Using python::

    $ cd rioxarray/
    $ python -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate

4. Install your local copy into a virtualenv.

    $ pip install -e .[dev]

5. Setup pre-commit hooks::

    $ pre-commit install

6. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

7. When you're done making changes, check that the tests pass::

    $ pytest

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub (this should trigger pre-commit checks)::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.


Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.8-3.10.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ pytest test/unit/test_show_versions.py::test_get_main_info
