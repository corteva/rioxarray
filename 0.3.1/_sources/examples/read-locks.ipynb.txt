    "# Example - Reading COGs in Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (COGs) can be internally chunked, which makes it possible to read them in parallel from multiple threads. However, the libraries `rioxarray` builds on, `rasterio` and `GDAL`, require some care to be used safely from multiple threads within a single process. By default, [rioxarray.open_rasterio](../rioxarray.rst#rioxarray-open-rasterio) will acquire a per-process lock when reading a chunk of a COG.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using `rioxarray` with [Dask](http://docs.dask.org/) through the `chunks` keyword, you can also specify the `lock=False` keyword to ensure that reading *and* operating on your data happen in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Also see [Reading and Writing with Dask](dask_read_write.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scheduler Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask has [several schedulers](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/scheduling.html) which run computations in parallel. Which scheduler is best depends on a variety of factors, including whether your computation holds Python's Global Interpreter Lock, whether how much data needs to be moved around, and whether you need more than one machine's computational power. This section about read-locks only applies if you have more than one thread in a process. This will happen with Dask's [local threaded scheduler](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/scheduling.html#local-threads) and its [distributed scheduler](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/) when configured to use more than one thread per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `xarray` objects will use the local `threaded` scheduler."

    "## Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "For maximum read performance, the chunking pattern you request should align with the internal chunking of the COG. Typically this means reading the data in a \"row major\" format: your chunks should be as wide as possible along the columns. We did that above with the chunks of `(4, \"auto\", -1)`. The `-1` says \"include all the columns\", and the `\"auto\"` will make the chunking along the rows as large as possible while staying in a reasonable limit (specified in `dask.config.get(\"array.chunk-size\")`).\n",
    "\n",
